Skimlinks Product API for Node.js

Skimlinks (skimlinks.com) is a service to help monetize websites.  It has two major services offered, 

* automagically search out key phrases that can be linked to products sold by affiliate merchants,
* an API listing out the products offered by affiliate merchants

What makes Skimlinks so interesting (besides being a well-thought-out service) is the sheer depth of the affiliate merchant relationships managed by the Skimlinks service.  As of this writing they have nearly 18,000 active merchants from 33 affiliate networks.  Working with Skimlinks to get affiliate merchant product data is a lot simpler than for you to manage all those relationships yourself.

The SkimlinksJS module allows Node.js programs to use the Skimlinks Product API.
